üìò PROJECT OVERVIEW:
We are building a web app that allows users to:
1. Paste AI chat links (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek).
2. Display chat messages on an editable visual artboard.
3. Preserve exact text formatting including:
   - Fractions, subscripts, superscripts
   - Absolute value symbols
   - Math/LaTeX formulas
   - Code blocks and markdown

Users will be able to edit text, adjust layout, rearrange blocks, and export a perfectly formatted PDF that matches the artboard view exactly.

üë• USER INTERFACE & ACCOUNTS:
- Sign up/login, dashboard for saved projects.
- Free tier with limited exports; paid tier for unlimited exports.
