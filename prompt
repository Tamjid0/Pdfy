Hey Gemini 👋

Let me explain my project idea before we start.

I’m building a  web app that allows users to create professional PDF documents directly in the browser — things like resumes, reports, or formatted text documents, more improtantly publicly shared ai chat into pdf prevesing the format.

The app has a toolbar with options such as:

Add Text → lets users insert and edit text boxes.

Add Math → allows inserting mathematical equations or symbols.

Add Image → enables uploading and placing images inside the document area.

There’s a main editor canvas where users can  edit, and format content.
Everything will later be exportable to a PDF (but the backend for that will be added in the future).

Currently, I have a demo folder that contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version of the app — no frameworks, just plain code.

Your job later will be to:

Convert the demo (HTML version) into a React + TypeScript+tailwindcss app.

Make sure the structure is clean, modular, and scalable.

Focus only on the frontend for now — I’ll handle the backend later.

For now, just confirm that you understand the project and the goal by replying:
✅ “Got it, I understand the project and I’m ready to convert it.”
