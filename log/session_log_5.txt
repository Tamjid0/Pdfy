**Session Log: 2025-10-24**

**Goal:** Scrape chat conversations from ChatGPT share URLs and convert to PDF.

**Previous Status (from `status` file):**
- Scraper was not working due to a `SyntaxError` in `server/scraper.js`.
- `curl` command was returning an empty array.

**Actions Taken:**
1.  Fixed the `SyntaxError` in `server/scraper.js` by correcting escape sequences in the `page.evaluate` function.
2.  Restarted the server.
3.  Tested the scraper with the URL: `https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68f9d92a006881918d4b85c85e43b7b8`
4.  The scraper is now working correctly.

**Current Status:**
- The scraper successfully extracted the chat content.
- The next step is to convert the extracted content to PDF.

**Scraped Content:**

Here’s a random text that naturally mixes math equations and chemistry formulas:\n\n---\n\nDuring the experiment, we observed that when H₂ + O₂ → H₂O, the reaction released a significant amount of energy. The change in enthalpy (ΔH) was calculated to be -285.8 kJ/mol. We also used the equation E = mc² to understand the energy-mass equivalence in this reaction. The rate of reaction was found to be proportional to the concentration of the reactants, following the law of mass action. We also noted that the pH of the resulting solution was 7, indicating it was neutral. The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, was used to calculate the volume of the gases involved. The quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a, was used to solve for the concentration of a certain ion in the solution. Finally, we used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), to determine the pH of a buffer solution we prepared."
